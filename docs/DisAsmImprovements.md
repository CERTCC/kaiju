# CERT Disassembly Improvements

CERT Disassembly Improvements is a Ghidra analyzer that improves the accuracy
of the disassembly output produced within Ghidra.
    
This analyzer should be run prior to any other CERT Kaiju tools. Most tools rely on
an accurate diassembly of the binary to have a complete and useful analysis,
so the improvements created by this analyzer improve the results of other tools.

    
## Details of the Improvements
    
A more detailed write-up is coming soon.
