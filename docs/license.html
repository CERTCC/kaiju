<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The licenses for most
software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By
contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all
its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using
it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library
General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>When we speak of free
software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses
are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of
free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these
things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>To protect your rights,
we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to
ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you
modify it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For example, if you distribute
copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We protect your rights
with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license
which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
software.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Also, for each author's
protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that
there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by
someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the original authors' reputations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Finally, any free program
is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in
effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear
that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at
all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The precise terms and
conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>0. This License applies
to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright
holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public
License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work,
and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as
&quot;you&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Activities other than
copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they
are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and
the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work
based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>1. You may copy and
distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in
any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with
the Program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You may charge a fee for
the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer
warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>2. You may modify your
copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based
on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the
terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>a) You must cause the
modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files
and the date of any change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>b) You must cause any
work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is
derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>c) If the modified
program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when
started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or
display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the
user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based
on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>These requirements apply
to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not
derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to
those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the
Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Thus, it is not the
intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In addition, mere
aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with
a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>3. You may copy and
distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code
or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
also do one of the following:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>a) Accompany it with the
complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
software interchange; or,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>b) Accompany it with a
written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a
charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
used for software interchange; or,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>c) Accompany it with the
information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source
code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only
if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an
offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The source code for a
work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For
an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all
modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the
scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which
the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If distribution of
executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated
place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same
place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>4. You may not copy,
modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or
distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>5. You are not required
to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else
grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative
works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or
works based on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>6. Each time you
redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute
or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose
any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>7. If, as a consequence
of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether
by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not
permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy
both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If any portion of this
section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is
intended to apply in other circumstances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It is not the purpose of
this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right
claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole
purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system,
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through
any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This section is intended
to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of
this License.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
