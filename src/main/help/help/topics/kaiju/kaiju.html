    <P>CERT Kaiju is a collection of binary analysis tools for Ghidra.</P>

    <P>This is a Ghidra/Java implementation of some features of the
    CERT Pharos Binary Analysis Framework,
    particularly the function hashing and malware analysis tools, but is expected to
    grow new tools and capabilities over time.</P>

    <P>As this is a new effort, this implementation does not yet have full feature
    parity with the original C++ implementation based on ROSE; however, the move
    to Java and Ghidra has actually enabled some new features not available in the
    original framework. Notably, improved handling of non-x86 architectures. Since
    some significant re-architecting of the framework and tools is taking place,
    and the move to Java and Ghidra enables different capabilities than the C++
    implementation, the decision was made to utilize new branding such that there
    would be less confusion between implementations when discussing the different
    tools and capabilities.</P>

    <P>Our intention for the near future is to maintain both the original Pharos
    framework as well as Kaiju, side-by-side, since both can provide unique
    features and capabilities.</P>

    <P>CAVEAT: As a prototype, there are many issues that may come up when
    evaluating the function hashes created by this plugin. For example, unlike
    the Pharos implementation, Kaiju's function hashing module will create hashes
    for very small functions (e.g., ones with a single instruction like RET
    causing many more unintended collisions). As such, analytical results may
    vary between this plugin and Pharos fn2hash.</P>
