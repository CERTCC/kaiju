Gradle will autogenerate HTML files in this directory during the build process.

Please do not add any HTML files to this directory.

If you'd like to add documentation, please add it in markdown format to the `docs/` directory. Markdown in the `docs/` directory will be automatically translated to Ghidra HTML files during the gradle build process.
