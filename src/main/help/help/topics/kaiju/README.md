Gradle will autogenerate HTML files and images in this directory during the build process.

Please **DO NOT MANUALLY ADD OR EDIT** any files in this directory. Any changes won't be committed properly.

If you'd like to add or edit documentation, please add it in markdown format to the `docs/` directory. Markdown in the `docs/` directory will be automatically translated to Ghidra HTML files during the gradle build process. (The code that translates the markdown into Ghidra HTML is in `buildSrc/`).
